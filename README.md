# GAShortestPath

Genetic Algorithm trying to find the shortest path.

.tsp files contain city coordinates (Lat & Long of cities) of a country

Due to it being a genetic algortm, it may never get the shortest path. Although, it will get close to it.

You can play around with the elite size, mutation rate, # of generations, and the population to see how close you can get to the shortest ppath for the given countries .tsp file.
